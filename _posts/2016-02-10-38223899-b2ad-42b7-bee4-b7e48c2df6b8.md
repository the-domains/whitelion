Ever since I can remember, I've enjoyed working on cars in some way, shape or form. When i was 13 i started subscribing to Car and Driver, Road & Track, and Motor trend. I learned about these cars and loved everything about them. Life took me in a different path as a career but this year has shown me that I can get paid to do what I love.
